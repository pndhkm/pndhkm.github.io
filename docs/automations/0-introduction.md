# Introduction

Automation in a tech stack refers to using tools, scripts, or workflows that execute tasks without manual intervention. This improves reliability, speed, and consistency across development, deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure operations.

#### Key Areas of Automation

| Area           | Purpose                                  | Common Tools                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Code & Build   | Compile, test, package automatically     | CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) |
| Deployment     | Deliver applications to servers/clusters | Ansible, Terraform, ArgoCD, Helm                  |
| Infrastructure | Provision VMs, networks, storage         | Terraform, CloudFormation                         |
| Configuration  | Enforce system state across servers      | Ansible, Puppet, Chef                             |
| Monitoring     | Auto-alerting & self-healing             | Prometheus + Alertmanager, Grafana, systemd       |
| Scripting      | Automate repetitive tasks                | Bash, Python                                      |
