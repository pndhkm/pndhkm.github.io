# Introduction

A database is an organized collection of structured data that allows efficient storage, retrieval, manipulation, and management. Databases are accessed using a Database Management System (DBMS) such as MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and others.

A DBMS provides:

* A query language (SQL)
* User authentication and permissions
* Backup and recovery features
* Concurrency control and transactions
