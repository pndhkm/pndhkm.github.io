# Disclaimer

All examples and commands here are for practice only. Since every environment can behave differently, it’s safer to try things inside a virtual machine first. Tools like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or any other VM platform work great for experimenting without risking your main system. Feel free to explore, but always do it responsibly.
