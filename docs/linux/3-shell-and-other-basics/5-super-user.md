# Super User

The superuser (also called root) has full control over the system.
You can switch to root or run commands with administrative privileges.

| Command        | Description                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| `sudo command` | Run a command as superuser |
| `su`           | Switch to the root user    |
| `whoami`       | Show the current username  |

Example:

```
sudo apt update
```

System asks for your password, then runs the command with superuser rights.
