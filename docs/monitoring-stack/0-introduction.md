# Introduction

## Monitoring Stack

A **monitoring stack** is a collection of tools and technologies designed to collect, process, visualize, and alert on system and application performance metrics. Its primary goal is to ensure the reliability, availability, and efficiency of IT infrastructure by providing real-time insights into system health and behavior.

A typical monitoring stack includes:

* **Data Collection:** Agents or exporters gather metrics, logs, and traces from servers, applications, and network devices.
* **Data Storage:** Collected data is stored in databases or time-series storage systems optimized for fast read/write operations.
* **Visualization:** Dashboards display metrics and trends in an intuitive way, helping teams identify anomalies or bottlenecks.
* **Alerting:** Configurable rules notify teams when metrics exceed predefined thresholds, enabling proactive incident response.

Monitoring stacks are essential for modern IT operations, DevOps practices, and cloud-native environments, providing a comprehensive overview of system performance and supporting continuous improvement.
