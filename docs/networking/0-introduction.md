# Introduction

## Networking

Networking is how computers share information with each other.
It allows devices to connect, send data, browse websites, and communicate across short or long distances.

## What Networking Does

* Lets computers connect to the internet
* Allows devices in the same place to share files or printers
* Helps services like websites and apps work
* Makes communication between systems possible

## Key Parts of Networking

### Interfaces

These are the “network ports” of a computer. They let a device connect to a network, either through cable or Wi-Fi.

### IP Address

This is like a home address for a computer so others know where to send data.

### Gateway

The gateway is like the exit door from your local network to the wider internet.

### DNS

DNS works like a phonebook. It converts website names (like `example.com`) into actual addresses so computers can find them.

### Routes

These decide which path data should take to reach another device or the internet.

## Simple View of How Data Moves

1. Your device has an IP address.
2. It asks DNS for the address of a website.
3. It sends the request through the gateway.
4. Data travels through routers until it reaches the destination.
5. The server replies, and the response travels back to your device.
